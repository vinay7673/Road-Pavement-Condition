# Road-Pavement-Condition

Developed a deep learning model using ResNet18 to classify road pavement conditions into four categories, with 92% accuracy.
Built a Flask-based web application enabling real-time image upload and road condition prediction, with confidence scores.
I trained the model using the Kaggle Road Quality Dataset, incorporating image augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
